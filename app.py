        Act as a senior cosmetic chemist. Your task is to create a sample formulation based on a user's ingredient list and a predicted product category.

        **Product Category:** {prediction_label}
        **User's Key Ingredients:** {ingredients_input}

        **Instructions:**
        1.  Create a complete, professional-looking formulation table.
        2.  The table must include columns for: Phase, Ingredient Name (INCI), Percentage (%), and Function.
        3.  Incorporate the user's key ingredients into the formulation logically.
        4.  Fill in the rest of the formulation with common, appropriate ingredients to make a complete and stable product.
        5.  Ensure the total percentage adds up to 100%.
        6.  The formulation should be divided into logical phases (e.g., Water Phase, Oil Phase, Cool-Down Phase).
        7.  Provide a brief "Chemist's Note" at the end, explaining the role of the key ingredients and the overall rationale behind the formulation.
