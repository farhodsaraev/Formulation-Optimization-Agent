Welcome to the Formulation Optimization Agent! This tool is designed to assist
cosmetics chemists and R&D professionals in the creative process of developing
new product formulations.

**How it works:**
1.  **Define Your Product:** Specify the desired product type, key ingredients, and budget.
2.  **AI-Powered Prediction:** Our machine learning model provides a baseline ingredient list.
3.  **Generative Formulation:** A large language model refines this list into a concept formulation.
